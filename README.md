# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
My project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, presenting their number of comparisons and swap operations.
By comparing these metrics, users can analyze and understand the efficiency of different algorithms.
This tool helps identify the most suitable sorting algorithm for specific scenarios, aiding in the optimization of sorting tasks.
It offers a concise and intuitive way to explore and evaluate sorting algorithm performance.
